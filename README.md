# Stock-analysis
## Overview of the Project
Stocks-Analysis project uses Steve's Green-Stocks dataset to help his parents to analyze their investments. By analysing 12 different Stocks in 2017 and 2018, we have already prepared a workbook to give more insight of some Stocks. However,in order to expand all data of entire Stocks' Market over the last few years, we need to use a better and faster programming code to analyze these complex data. By refactoring existing coding, the goal of this project is to seeking higher efficient programming codes to run through all Stocks data. 
## Results
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code.Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
We use VBA to refactor our coding, loop through all the dataset few times. We found that the refactored script works more efficient. The execution times of the original script and the refactor script for stocks in 2017 shows as below:
